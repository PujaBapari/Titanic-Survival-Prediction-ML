# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and building a Machine Learning model to predict the survival probability of passengers on the Titanic.

## 📊 Project Highlights
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualized data to find patterns in survival based on Pclass, Age, and Gender.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values for Age and Embarked; dropped high-null columns like Cabin.
- **Machine Learning:** Implemented a **Random Forest Classifier**.
- **Performance:** Achieved a model accuracy of **81.01%**.

## 📁 Files in this Repository
- `Titanic_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full Python code.
- `train.csv` & `test.csv`: Input datasets.

## 🛠️ Key Libraries Used
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for model training and evaluation.
